# AI-Generated Text Detection

This repository contains tools and methods for detecting AI-generated text using advanced machine learning techniques. The project is implemented entirely using Jupyter Notebooks for ease of experimentation and presentation.

---

## Features

- **AI Text Detection**: Identify whether input text is generated by AI models.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Explore and train models specifically designed for text analysis.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Use Jupyter Notebooks for reproducibility and hands-on experimentation.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OA2in/AI-Generated-Text-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AI-Generated-Text-Detection
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies (ensure you have Python and `pip` installed):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Navigate to the relevant notebook to explore or run the detection pipeline.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to test with your own text or datasets.
